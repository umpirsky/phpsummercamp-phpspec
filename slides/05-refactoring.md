#### Step 5 - More examples, refactoring

A) Add one more example for convert method with different currency.

B) Run `$ ./bin/phpspec run`, make sure it fails.

C) Refactor `CurrencyConverter` to make console green again!

**GOAL**

* You should have `CurrencyConverter::convert()` method that really converts currencies.
* You should have 2 passed examples.

**STUCK?**
