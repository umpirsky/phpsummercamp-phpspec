#### Step 4 - Describe convert method

A) Add basic example for convert method to `CurrencyConverterSpec`.

B) Run `$ ./bin/phpspec run` and use code generator to generate `convert()` method.

C) Make newly created example pass.

**GOAL**

* You should have `CurrencyConverter::convert()` method described and implemented.
* You should have two 2 examples.

**EXTRA CREDIT**

Create one more example for `convert()` method, maybe with different value or currencie.
It fails, right? Try to generate html report from PHPSpec console, show it to your neighbor! ;)

**STUCK?**
